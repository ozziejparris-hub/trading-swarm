json_safety.py — shared safe-JSON primitives for every brain/*.json writer.

Companion file: /home/parison/projects/first-repo/scripts/json_safety.py
(separate repo — cannot import this one, kept behaviourally identical by
hand). The property that actually makes cross-repo writes safe is NOT
"same implementation" — it's the LOCK PATH: both derive
`<resolved target>.lock` the same way, so an fcntl.flock() taken here and
an fcntl.flock() taken by the sibling file are the same kernel-level lock
on the same inode, regardless of which repo/process/language took it. If
you ever change the lock-path derivation in _lock_path() below, change it
in the sibling file too — otherwise cross-repo writes silently stop
serializing (see tests/test_cross_repo_lock.py for the proof).

Three protections, each separately load-bearing (Fable swarm audit Area
1.3, and the first-repo atomicity siblings that followed it):

  1. json_lock(path) — fcntl exclusive lock on a SIDECAR file (<path>.lock),
     never the target file itself. Hold it across the ENTIRE
     read-modify-write, not just the write half — locking only the write
     still lets two readers both load stale data and lose an update.
  2. atomic_write_json(path, data) — temp file in the same directory,
     fsync, os.replace. A crash mid-write leaves the ORIGINAL untouched.
     Rolls the previous file forward into <path>.bak first.
  3. load_json_or_raise(path, default) — a genuinely missing file
     bootstraps `default`; a file that exists but won't parse is backed
     up untouched and RAISES CorruptJSONError. Never silently
     reinitializes over an unrecovered original. load_json_tolerant() is
     the explicit, narrow exception for files whose content is truly
     disposable (see call sites for why each one qualifies).
