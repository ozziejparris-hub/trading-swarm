## How This File Works

This file is the single source of truth for system performance
metrics. It is read by the orchestrator weekly summary and by
the performance-analyst-agent as the baseline for trend analysis.

**Writing protocol:**
- performance-analyst-agent overwrites the "Current Week" section
  every Monday before the 8am Telegram report
- It preserves the "Baseline" section permanently —
  never overwrite or delete the baseline block
- All historical weekly values live in
  /brain/agent-outputs/performance-analyst/ — this file
  holds current values only, not history

## System Baseline (March 16 2026)

These are the founding numbers. Every future metric is
measured against this starting point. Do not modify.

### Polymarket Trader Database
```
Total traders tracked:          53,140
ELO range:                      300 – 3,500
Active traders (ELO >= 1550):   677
Legendary traders (ELO >= 2175): ~15
Maximum ELO observed:           3,500 (0xb442, 4 closed positions)
Database size:                  1,581 MB
Worker coverage:                99.7%
Closed positions calculated:    951,694
```

### Calibration Baseline (Brier Scores)
```
Traders with Brier scores:      897
Best Brier score:               0.0798  (superforecaster territory)
Brier score range:              0.08 – 0.89
Traders excellent (< 0.10):     388  (superforecaster tier per Tetlock)
Traders good (0.10 – 0.20):     489
Traders acceptable (0.20-0.25): to be measured
Traders below random (> 0.25):  to be measured
System target Brier:            < 0.20 (minimum)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Performance (Sharpe)
```
Traders with Sharpe data:       761
Sharpe range:                   -1.66 – 1.58
```

### Composite Skill Scores (Phase 3b)
```
Traders scored:                 13,021
ABOVE AVERAGE:                  304
AVERAGE:                        12,715
Below average:                  remainder
```

### Behavioral Scores (March 16 fix applied)
```
timing_score coverage:          3,231 traders
patience_score coverage:        2,194 traders
kelly_alignment_score coverage: 1,153 traders
Note: encoding bug fixed 2026-03-16 (utf-8 flag added)
```

### Kelly Criterion Reference Values
```
Recommended fraction:           0.25x – 0.50x full Kelly
Single position cap:            25% of capital
Correlated position cap:        50% of capital
At 2x Kelly:                    growth rate = 0 (do not exceed)
```

### Validation Thresholds (for backtest-agent)
```
Sharpe minimum:                 1.0 (necessary, not sufficient)
Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR):    > 0.95 (required)
PBO maximum:                    < 0.10 (required)
Transaction cost assumed:       2% per trade (Polymarket fee)
Minimum trades in backtest:     30
```

### Brier Score Reference Thresholds
```
Excellent:                      < 0.10  (superforecaster per Tetlock)
Good:                           0.10 – 0.20
Acceptable:                     0.20 – 0.25
Random baseline:                0.25  (always predicting 50%)
System target:                  < 0.20 minimum
```

### Known Issues at Baseline (March 16 2026)
```
- trades.notified / completed / was_successful columns are
  write-only — nothing reads them (low priority hygiene task)
- weighted_consensus_system.py deprecated but still called
  by Phase 2 scheduler (code-hygiene-agent task)
- Worker backlog growing ~150-200/hour — monitor trend
```

Stopping rules (halt all research if either fails):
- RQ1.1: ELO has no predictive validity → redesign ELO system
- RQ3.2: Markets efficient vs elite consensus → pivot edge source
